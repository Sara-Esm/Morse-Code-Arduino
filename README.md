# Arduino Morse Code Translator with LCD Display

This Arduino project utilizes an LCD display to translate user input into Morse code. It provides a user-friendly interface, real-time display of input and translated code, and customizable mapping. The project is built using an Arduino Uno board and an LCD display.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for easy interaction
- Translates user input into Morse code
- Real-time display of input and translated Morse code
- Customizable mapping of characters to Morse code
- Expandable functionality for future enhancements

## Components

- Arduino Uno board: Acts as the microcontroller and central processing unit of the project.
- LCD display: Provides visual output for showcasing the original input text and the corresponding Morse code translation.
- Jumper wires: Used for connecting the Arduino board to the LCD display.
- Potentiometer: Enables adjusting the contrast and brightness of the LCD display for optimal viewing.

## Installation

1. Connect the Arduino Uno board to the LCD display using the jumper wires.
2. Upload the provided Arduino code to the Arduino Uno board.
3. Make sure the potentiometer is properly connected and adjusted for optimal LCD display visibility.

## Usage

1. Open the Arduino Serial Monitor.
2. Enter the text you want to translate into Morse code.
3. Press Enter to see the original text and the corresponding Morse code translation displayed on the LCD screen.
4. Repeat the process to translate more text into Morse code.

## Customization

- Modify the Morse code mapping in the Arduino code to accommodate different languages or encoding schemes.
- Add additional features, such as sound output or wireless communication, to enhance the project's functionality.
